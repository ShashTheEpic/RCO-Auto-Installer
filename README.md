# FAQ

## Why Does This Exist?
I got bored and some of my friends don't trust the RCOInstaller.exe even though the project is open source.

## How do I use this?
First you need python which you can get [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). I recommend installng the latest version. Once installed, run the exe and go through the installation like any normal app. If you still don't understand use this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjE7XQV4s-k) from a random guy i found on youtube.

Now that you have installed python, go ahead and download this repository. Once downloaded, unzip the zip file and open the folder containing RCO.py. Now click on the directory (something like: C:\Users\xxxxx\Downloads\Roblox-Client-Optimizer-Auto-Update-Installer-Python-main\Roblox-Client-Optimizer-Auto-Update-Installer-Python-main) and replace it with the text cmd and press enter. A command promt window should now pop up. Type python RCO.py and press enter. RCO has now been updated/installed
