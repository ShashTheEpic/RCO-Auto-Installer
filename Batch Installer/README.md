# Batch Installer (easiest)
[Downlaod](https://github.com/ShashTheEpic/RCO-Auto-Installer/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.0.zip) the whole repository, unzip it then navigate to `RCO-Auto-Installer` > `Batch Installer` > `RCO.bat`. Now run `RCO.bat` by opening it.

Don't trust `RCO.bat`? Well you can view what the batch script is executing. Open Notepad or any other text editora, press `ctrl + o` and navigate to `RCO.bat`. Open it and you can view the code, with assistance of my comments so you know what's going on.
